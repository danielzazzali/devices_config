The command `wget --page-requisites --convert-links --mirror http://localhost` is used to download a complete local copy of a website for offline viewing.

- **`--page-requisites`**: Ensures that all necessary resources (such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files) required to properly display the page are downloaded.
- **`--convert-links`**: Modifies the links in the downloaded HTML files so they point to the local copies rather than the original online URLs.
- **`--mirror`**: Creates a full mirror of the website, which includes downloading the entire site structure and content.

In summary, this command retrieves not only the HTML page but also all its associated resources and adjusts links for offline use.
